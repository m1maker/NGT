Hello. These are instructions for using NGTBuilder.
Anywhere on your computer, create any folder with any name.
Place all the files in the NGTMain folder of this archive into this folder.
In the folder with your project, create a file with the extension .ngt and write the following code.
AS
void main(){
alert("So", "This is test message");
}



Then save this file.
Now in the project folder, where there are NGT components and a file with the .ngt extension.

If you are using Windows Explorer, press f4.
Remove all text from the editor and write
cmd
Then on the command line write this:
NGTScript.exe test.ngt -d
Where the first argument is the file name, and the second -d means that the interpreter should run the NGT file.
