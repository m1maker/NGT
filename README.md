# NGT: (New Game Toolkit)

Welcome to NGT! An open source game engine using [AngelScript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/) as its internal scripting language.

Currently, NGT is positioned as a game engine for users with visual impairments, but we should think about the possibility of making it possible to create visual games.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Screen Readers:** Accessibility is key for users with visual impairments, allowing user to receive speech messages with any screen reader.
- **3D Soundsystem:** Use 3D audio positioning, reverbs, lowpass, highpass and notch filters to achieve realistic sound in games.
- **File and Filesystem:** Use this to work with the user progress (For example, to save a game).
- **Encryption:** Use the AES256 algorithm to protect user passwords, game resources, etc.
- **Networking system:** Create online games.
