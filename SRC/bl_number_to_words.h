* USAGE
*
* This is a single-file library. To use it, do something like the following in one .c file.
* #define BL_NUMWORDS_IMPLEMENTATION
* #include "BL_NUMBER_TO-WORDS.h"
*
* You can then #include this file in other parts of the program as you would with any other header file.

    /* Convert an unsigned 64 bit integer to words.
    *
* The function uses the convention that "one thousand million" is one billion.
*
* number is the number to convert. The entire unsigned 64 bit range is supported.
* output is the buffer into which the output string should be written. It may be NULL.
* output_size is the total number of bytes that the output buffer can hold.
* If output is NULL, output_size is ignored.
* If output is non-NULL and the string is longer than output_size, the output will be truncated but will still be NULL terminated.
* If output is non-NULL and output_size is 0, output remains untouched.
* The function returns the total number of bytes required to hold the complete output string (including the NULL terminator).
* If the return value is greater than output_size, this indicates that the buffer was too small and had to be truncated.
* You may then resize your buffer so that it can hold the number of bytes returned by this function and invoke it again.
